### Data

I read _Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE): a prospective cohort study_, a study published in 2017 by _The Lancet_, a family of medical journals that is known for its high standards for papers.

The researchers took data from 135,335 people in 18 countries (of varying socioeconomic levels and stages of development)—something that the study said was not done enough, instead focusing predominantly on higher-income countries, despite the fact that lower- and middle-income countries had 80% of the total cases of cardiovascular disease. They only measured the percentage energy from six things—carbohydrates, total fat, total protein, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. They also only measure the percentage of each quintile by how much of the given macronutrient they consume, total mortality, major cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular disease mortality, non-cardiovascular disease mortality. Compared to the sample size, this is a short list of variables that they tested for, making it highly unlikely that they p-hacked their results.

Then, they adjusted the CIs and "hazard ratios" (which they in turn calculated with a sophisticated algorithm) adjusted for age, sex, education, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, urban or rural location, and energy intake.

This large data sample size meant that trends observed were much less likely to be coincidental. They separated people into seven regions based on differences in diets around the world. They provided p-values for every data point, and the vast majority of those p-values fell below 0.05 (and some fell on the other side of the curve—that is), but not all of them. With these numbers, they do not seem to make any outlandish claims, and their complete transparency helps to back this up.

### Results

I believe their findings should be trusted because the experiment is very clear in its purpose—to test the effects of five different macronutrients on strokes, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Their findings are also strongly rooted in their data.

This study is investigator-initiated, meaning that it was initiated and managed by researchers as opposed to pharmaceutical companies. The data is replicable, and much of the paper is devoted to the actual methodology the scientists used in collecting this data. It also had many sources of funding from different institutions in different countries; it is therefore highly unlikely that the researchers are biased to produce any results.

The paper makes quite sensational findings:

> High carbohydrate intake was associated with higher risk of total mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to lower total mortality. Total fat and types of fat were not associated with cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease mortality, whereas saturated fat had an inverse association with stroke.

This challenged an idea that nutritionists had held for a while. This may be seen as an effect of "publish or parish," but I think that the rigorous nature of the study (and small number of dependent variables they tested), careful analysis of data (which is based on the data included in the paper), and transparency of everything (including potential sources of error) lends itself to the fact that, while surprising, their findings were scientific and accurate.
