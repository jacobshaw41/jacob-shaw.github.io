## Study

I looked at [_The Psychology of Superorganisms: Collective Decision Making by Insect Societies_](http://www.public.asu.edu/~spratt1/Publications/Sasaki%20and%20Pratt%202018.pdf) by Takao Sasaki and Stephen C. Pratt, published in the _Annual Review of Entomology_.

## Proposed new study

### 1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.

How does the number of ants in a colony effect the amount of time it takes them to complete a task (expressed as a proportion to how long it takes similarly-sized colonies to get the food with no task to solve)?

### 2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?

Ants already in colonies in the genus _Temnothorax_. We need to know that they're in the same colony or else the ants might not be willing to work together otherwise.

### 3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.

Five hundred ant colonies of different sizes (from 500 to 500,000 ants). We need a huge range of data points. This might be expensive, but a man in a trench coat showed up to the lab with a briefcase of Russian rubles.

### 4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?

Ants are virtually indistinguishable; as such, there is basically no need for advanced sampling methods that account for differences between individual ants.
The colonies, however, should be sampled via interval sampling. But first, sort them by their coordinates (it'd have to be two dimensional), and then start from a random point and skip the same number of colonies each time until the groups sample are large enough.

### 5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.

Null: There is no correlation between the number of ants present and the amount of time it takes them to solve a problem.
Alternative: There is an inverse correlation between the number of ants present and the amount of time it takes them to solve a problem.

### 6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.**

We still need to know the number of ants in every colony are. The independent variable is the number of ants in the colony. The dependent variable is the amount of time it takes for the ants to perform the same task.
In are two groups: the control and the experimental group. The control would be given food in the normal way ants get their food—in order to get this food, the ants only need to walk to the food and carry it back to their colony. The experimental group would be given a relatively simple task that prevents them from reaching their food (like a barricade and/or flamethrower).
We need the control group to have no task because it gives us a measure of how long it "normally" takes a particular number of ants to work together to get food. This is what the experimental group is compared to. This helps to isolate the variable of their time—by comparing the experimental group's time to that of a control group, we can see, by proportion, how the number of ants helped to solve the task (as opposed to just pick up food).

### 7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.**

Half of the sample group would be  selected (via another round of intervallic sorting by coordinates—again, to ensure a geographic diversity in both groups and to reduce the chances of accidental clustering found in random sampling) to be the control group, and the other half would be the experimental group.

### 8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.**

Each individual colony would be timed to see how long it takes for them to perform their task (all of these tasks must be standardized—that is, as close as the same as possible). The times of the experimental group would then be plotted against the number of ants in the colony. Then, the I would do the same thing to the control group and then compare the two. If the experimental group's time decreased in proportion to the control group's time as the number of ants increased, the alternative hypothesis would be supported. If, instead, the number of ants did not seem to relate to the time it took them to solve the task as compared to the control group, the null hypothesis would be supported.

### 9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?

One possible bias is that the ant colonies may have different skill sets—i.e. more practice with one type of task than another. While the large sample size may help reduce one-off differences, there is likely to be a lack of practice of overcoming big tasks in small tasks if the alternative hypothesis is correct—that larger tribes are better equipped at collective problem solving. To account for this, experimenters may want to take large colonies and manually remove ants from them so that they have skill but not numbers that are comparable to their larger counterparts. However, this would be creating an unnatural scenario and possibly create unforeseeable biases.

Also, there could've been problems with the selection processes—while I believe sorting by location would be a good option, it is possible that there are correlations between location and colony size that will lead to biases in data. Thus, once sample frame is established, they should be weighted so that observed discrepancies between groups are accounted for.

Finally, this is only done on one ant genus. To get better, more universal results, this experiment should be repeated on different species of ants and possibly on other organisms that have superorganismic characteristics.

## Muffin Recipe

I came across [this muffin recipe](https://damndelicious.net/2014/03/24/coffee-cake-muffins/). Coffee cake muffins are new to me—as you can expect, I am obsessed.
