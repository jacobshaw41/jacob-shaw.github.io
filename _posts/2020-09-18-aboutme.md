# About
My name is Jacob Shaw, and I am a Junior at Horace Mann School in New York City.
 
# Computer Science
I have been coding since I was very young, but only relatively recently on Python and Java. I like coding because it provides an outlet for my creativity and a concrete means of understanding the world.
 
I took Computer Science 2 last year, a class that changed the way I thought about computer science—from the mechanics of coding to the way it helps us (and threatens us) in the world.
 
I am currently taking Pre Calculus.
 
# Hobbies
When not coding or studenting, you can often find me baking bread or [composing classical music](jacob-shaw.com). ![A score of a piece that I _did not_ write](https://leonardbernstein.com/uploads/pages/images/OMNIBUS_-_Beethoven_Fifth_Symphony_-_First_Page1-1480534940-lboximg.jpg)
 
# Something I'm looking forward to
I'm looking forward to my Computer Science class this year—Art of Data. This class, meeting four days every week, will challenge me to think about Computer Science in a new way. Moreover, I know that it will change the way that I look at data, which are so often considered unambiguous fact in today's world.


1. Write about your prior experience with computer science.
2. Write about something you like -- this can be a hobby, sport, TV show, game, book, food, artist, etc. 
  Make sure to include links and images so readers get a good idea!
3. Write about something you're looking forward to this year. Give a short explanation!
