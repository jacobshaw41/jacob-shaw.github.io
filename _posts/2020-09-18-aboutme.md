# About
My name is Jacob Shaw, and I am a Junior at Horace Mann School in New York City.
 
# Computer Science
I have been coding since I was very young, but only relatively recently on Python and Java. I like coding because it provides an outlet for my creativity and a concrete means of understanding the world.
 
I took Computer Science 2 last year, a class that changed the way I thought about computer scienceâ€”from the mechanics of coding to the way it helps us (and threatens us) in the world.
 
# Hobbies
When not coding or studenting, you can often find me baking or [composing classical music](jacob-shaw.com).

  Make sure to include links and images so readers get a good idea!
3. Write about something you're looking forward to this year. Give a short explanation!
